# What are we doing today?

This assigment implements everything rom the First Game phaser 3 tutorial! We will work to add features like a Game Over screen, the ability to restart the game, and sounds on this assignment. You will be expected to submit the assignment, so please keep up and ask for help if you need it!

You can either click the Gitpod icon above to open this assignment in an online IDE (which usually works but can get fussy on bad internet) OR use Github Desktop to download the assignment to your computer and open it in VS Code.

# What are we doing today?

This assigment implements everything rom the First Game phaser 3 tutorial! We will work to add features like a Game Over screen, the ability to restart the game, and sounds on this assignment. You will be expected to submit the assignment, so please keep up and ask for help if you need it!

To open the project, you can either download it to your computer with Github Desktop and open in VS Code OR you can open it using GitPod, an online IDE. To do that, go to your address bar and add `gitpod.io/#` before the address of your repository. Once you launch it once, you can re-open it by simply going back to https://gitpod.io and opening it.
